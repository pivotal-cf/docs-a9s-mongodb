This topic provides usage guidance for binding all a9s Data Services to cloud
foundry apps.

## <a id='binding-information'></a> Binding information

Binding information is  delivered to apps via the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment
variable. This variable is a JSON object string.

### Structure

- hash of services (e.g a9s-redis40, a9s-postgresql94...)
  - array of service instances
    - name
      - string
    - tags
      - array of tag strings
    - credentials
      - service specific credentials

### `VCAP_SERVICES` example

```json
{
  "a9s-rabbitmq36": [
    {
      "name": "example-rabbitdb",
      "tags": [ "rabbitmq" ],
      "credentials": {
        "host": "localhost",
        "password": "quest",
        "port": 5672,
        "uri": "amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672",
        "username": "guest"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## <a id='best-practices'></a> Best practices

1. Do not rely on order in `VCAP_SERVICES`
2. Do not rely on service versions
3. Do not hard code service instance names

## <a id='suggested-practices'></a> Suggested practices

### Option A

Specify the service name via an environment viable with your app manifest. This
is trivial to implement in an app, and follows the [best
practices](using-services-in-apps.html#best-practices) making it easy to rebind an apps without changing
code in your app.

### Option B

Look for a service instance with a tag, that can be hard coded in an app,
without compromising the [best practices](using-services-in-apps.html#best-practices). This is trivial to
implement, but you must clearly document the tag you have hard coded. The
advantage of this option is not having to update a variable in an app manifest
when rebinding.

## <a id='rabbitmq-go-example'></a> RabbitMQ Go example

Here you can find a [RabbitMQ
example](https://github.com/anynines/a9s-rabbitmq-app/blob/44b336e8c217e91fe4730b09ad102e97734fa8df/main.go#L90)
of how to simultaneously implement [suggested practices](using-services-in-apps.html#suggested-practices) A
and B in an app.
