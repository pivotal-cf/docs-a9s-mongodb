After updating the a9s MongoDB for Pivotal Platform tile, run the Deployment Updater errand
to update all provisioned service instances to the new service and stemcell versions.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> anynines recommends running the
<a href="./installing.html#errands" target="_blank">smoke tests</a> before running
this errand.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> To run the errand, you must know how to use the
BOSH Director. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-6/customizing/trouble-advanced.html"
target="_blank">Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI</a>.</p>

1. SSH into the Ops Manager VM:
  ```bash
  $ ssh ubuntu@OPS-MANAGER-FQDN
  Password: ***********
  ```
2. Log in to the BOSH Director.
  ```bash
  $ bosh login
  Your username: director
  Enter password: DIRECTOR\_CREDENTIAL
  Logged in as 'director'
  ```
3. Run `bosh deployments` and record the name of the a9s MongoDB for Pivotal Platform
  deployment from the **Name** column:
   <pre>
  $ bosh deployments
  Using environment '172.28.10.11' as client 'ops_manager'
  &nbsp;
  Name                                    Release(s)                            Stemcell(s)                                       Team(s)                              Cloud Config
  a9s-mongodb-94443f82b52dcf333bbd        a9s-consul/18                         bosh-vsphere-esxi-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent/3468.25  -                                    latest
                                            ...
                                            template-uploader-errand/120
  cf-7fcd1f89150a96b381d0                 backup-and-restore-sdk/1.2.1          bosh-vsphere-esxi-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent/3468.25  -                                    latest
                                            ...
                                            uaa/52.7
    </pre>

4. Force the update for all existing a9s MongoDB for Pivotal Platform instances.

    <pre>
  $ bosh -d a9s-mongodb-0476d61a219a39bf0e1b run-errand deployment-updater
  Using environment '172.28.10.11' as client 'ops_manager'
  &nbsp;
  Using deployment 'a9s-mongodb-0476d61a219a39bf0e1b'
  &nbsp;
  Task 14855
  &nbsp;
  Task 14855 | 12:02:00 | Preparing deployment: Preparing deployment (00:00:00)
  &nbsp;

  Task 14855 Started  Tue May 29 12:06:13 UTC 2018
  Task 14855 Finished Tue May 29 12:26:22 UTC 2018
  Task 14855 Duration 00:01:09
  Task 14855 done
  &nbsp;

    </pre>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Depending on the number of service instances,
the Deployment Updater might take significant time to finish running.
BOSH shows no logging output while the errand runs.</p>
