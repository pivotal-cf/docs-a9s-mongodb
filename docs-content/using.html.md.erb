This topic describes how to use a9s MongoDB for PCF after it has been successfully installed. For more information, see [Installing and Configuring a9s MongoDB for PCF](./installing.html)

##<a id='using'></a>Use a a9s MongoDB for PCF with an Application

To use a9s MongoDB for PCF with an application, create a service instance and bind the service instance
to your application. For more information on managing service instances, see <a href="https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/managing-services.html" target="_blank">Managing Service 
Instances with the CLI</a>.

### View the a9s MongoDB for PCF Service

After the tile is installed, you can see the *a9s-mongodb* and its service
plans appear in your PCF marketplace. Run `cf marketplace` to
see the service listing:
<pre class="terminal">
$ cf marketplace
Getting services from marketplace in org test / space test as admin...
OK

service      plans                                           description                                                                        
a9s-mongodb  mongodb-single-small, mongodb-cluster-small,    This is the anynines mongodb 32 service. 
             mongodb-single-big, mongodb-cluster-big         
</pre>

You can create MongoDB service instances based on the following service plans:

* mongodb-single-small: provisions a single-VM MongoDB server.
* mongodb-cluster-small: provisions a MongoDB cluster service running on three VMs.
* mongodb-single-big:
* mongodb-cluster-big:


### Create a Service Instance

To provision a MongoDB database, run `cf create-service`, for example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf create-service a9s-mongodb mongodb-single-small my-mongodb-service
</pre>

Depending on your infrastructure and service broker utilization, it may take several minutes to create the service instance.

Check the creation status using `cf services`. This displays a list of all your service instances. To check the status of a specific service instance, 
run `cf service NAME-OF-YOUR-SERVICE`.


### Bind an Application to a Service Instance

After your database is created, run `cf bind-service` to bind the service to your application:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf bind-service a9s-mongodb-app my-mongodb-service
</pre>

### Restage or Restart Your Application

To enable your application to access the service instance, run `cf restage` or `cf restart` to restage or restart your application.


##<a id='deleting'></a> Delete an a9s MongoDB for PCF Service Instance

<p class="note">Before deleting a service instance, you must backup data stored in your database. This operation cannot be undone and all the data is lost when the service is deleted.</p>

Before you can delete a service instance, it needs to be unbound from all applications.

### List Available Services

Run `cf service` to list your available services.

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf service                                                                                                                                               

Getting services in org test / space test as admin...
OK

name                 service       plan                   bound apps        last operation
my-mongodb-service   a9s-mongodb   mongodb-single-small   a9s-mongodb-app   create succeeded
</pre>

This example shows that `my-mongodb-service` is bound to the `a9s-mongodb-app` application.

### Unbind a Service Instance

Run `cf unbind-service` to unbind the service from your application.

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf unbind-service a9s-mongodb-app my-mongodb-service
</pre>


### Delete a Service Instance

After unbinding the service, it is no longer bound to an application. Run `cf delete-service` to delete the service:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf delete-service my-mongodb-service
</pre>

It may take several minutes to delete the service. Deleting a service deprovisions the corresponding infrastructure resources.
Run the `cf services` command to check the deletion status.


##<a id='credentials'></a> Obtain Service Instance Access Credentials

After a service instance is bound to an application, the credentials of your MongoDB
database is stored in the environment variables of the application. Run `cf env APP-NAME` to display the environment variables. 

The credentials can be found under
the <a href="https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/environment-variable.html#VCAP-SERVICES" target="_blank">VCAP_SERVICES</a> key.

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf env a9s-mongodb-app
Getting env variables for app a9s-mongodb-app in org test / space test as admin...
OK
