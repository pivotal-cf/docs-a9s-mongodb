This topic describes how to install and configure a9s MongoDB for PCF.

##<a id='prerequisites'></a> Prerequisites

Before installing a9s MongoDB for PCF, ensure that you have installed and configured the products and tiles listed in [Requirements](./index.html#reqs).


##<a id='install'></a> Install and Configure a9s MongoDB for PCF

To install a9s MongoDB for PCF, perform the following steps:

1. Download the product file from the Pivotal Network.

2. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Import a Product**
to upload the product file.

3. Click **Add** next to the uploaded a9s MongoDB for PCF tile in the Ops Manager
**Available Products** view to add it to your staging area.

4. Click the newly added tile, then click **Settings** to review the configuration settings for each tab.
	See the following sections for more information on how to configure the properties on each side-tab:
	* [Assign AZs and Networks](#azs)
	* [Configure BOSH Errands](#errands)
	* [Configure Service Plans](#configure-service-instance)
	* [Configure Stemcells](#stemcell)

5. Click **Apply Changes** to deploy the service.

After installing the a9s MongoDB for PCF, it is available in the list of marketplace services. For more information, see [Using a9s MongoDB for PCF](./using.html).

##<a id="azs"></a>Assign AZs and Networks

Use **Assign AZs and Networks** to configure the location of service instance jobs. You should configure your network to balance cluster jobs between as many AZs as possible.

##<a id='errands'></a>Configure BOSH Errands

Use **Errands** to configure the BOSH Errands used by a9s MongoDB for PCF. For more information, see the [Understanding Lifecycle Errands](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/tile-errands.html) topic.

### Post-Deploy Errands

 * **Run BOSH Configurator**:
	This errand configures **a9s BOSH for PCF** so that it can provision MongoDB
  service instances. When enabled, this errand uploads the required releases in
  the a9s BOSH Director. Disabling this errand may speed up the deployment of
  all tiles.

	<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To ensure your configuration remains up-to-date, disable this errand only when necessary.</p>

 * **Run Template Uploader**:
	This errand is required to configure generic components that are included in a9s MongoDB for PCF with MongoDB  configurations.
	Disabling this errand may speed up the deployment of all tiles.

	<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To ensure your configuration remains up-to-date, disable this errand only when necessary.</p>

 * **Run Broker Registrar**:
	This errand registers the a9s MongoDB for PCF service broker
	at the Elastic Runtime. This causes the service be available in the Elastic Runtime
	marketplace.

 * **Run Smoke Tests**:
 This errand runs a series of basic tests against your a9s MongoDB for PCF
 installation to ensure that it is configured properly. Those tests may
 take a certain amount of time, probably over 30 minutes.

### Pre-Delete Errands

 * **Delete all a9s MongoDB instances**:
	This errand deletes all a9s MongoDB instances created by PCF end users  with `cf create-service` .
	<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: This is a destructive task that cannot be undone. It irrecoverably deletes all VMs of the service instances. If a service instance is bound to an app or service keys exist, the errand fails.</p>

 * **Run Broker Deregistrar**:
	This will deregister the a9s MongoDB for PCF service broker in Elastic Runtime. This errand removes the a9s MongoDB service from the Elastic Runtime marketplace.

##<a id="configure-service-instance"></a> Configure Service Plans

The size and types of VMs used to provision service instances of a given service plan are specified in the **IaaS Settings** of the **a9s BOSH for PCF** tile. For more information, see the [a9s BOSH for PCF](../a9s-bosh/installing.html) documentation.

Each service plan is defined in the following fields:

| Plan | Specs for | Field |
|------|-------|-------|
|mongodb-single-small| Virtual Machine<br /> Persistent Disk | Cloud properties for the VM Type Small<br /> Cloud properties for the Disk Type Small|
|mongodb-cluster-small| Virtual Machines<br /> Persistent Disks | Cloud properties for the VM Type Small<br /> Cloud properties for the Disk Type Small|
|mongodb-single-big| Virtual Machine<br /> Persistent Disk | Cloud properties for the VM Type Large<br /> Cloud properties for the Disk Type Big|
|mongodb-cluster-big| Virtual Machines<br /> Persistent Disks | Cloud properties for the VM Type Large<br /> Cloud properties for the Disk Type Big|

##<a id="stemcell"></a>Configure Stemcells

Use **Configure Stemcells** enable another stemcell than the default one. Click **Import Stemcell** to upload a new stemcell.

##<a id='deployment_updater'></a>Upgrade Existing Service Instances After a Tile Update
This errand automatically updates the stemcell and all provisioned a9s MongoDB for PCF service instances to their lastest version after updating the tile.<br />
The errand has to be run manually as explained below.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: It is recommended to run the <a href="./installing.html#errands" target="_blank">smoke tests</a> before running this errand.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To use the errand must know how to use the Ops Manager Director. For more information, see the 
<a href="http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-9/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#prepare" target="_blank">Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI</a> topic.</p>
1. SSH into Ops Manager
<pre class="terminal">
$ ssh ubuntu@OPS-MANAGER-FQDN
Password: ***********
</pre>
2. Target the BOSH Director
<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh --ca-cert /var/tempest/workspaces/default/root\_ca\_certificate target OPS-MANAGER-DIRECTOR-IP
Target set to DIRECTOR\_UUID
</pre>
3. Log into BOSH Director
<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh login
Your username: director
Enter password: DIRECTOR\_CREDENTIAL
Logged in as 'director'
</pre>
4. Locate the a9s MongoDB for PCF deployment name.
<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh deployments
</pre>
The output should look similar to this:
<pre class="terminal">

5. All deployment manifests are stored in the folder `/var/tempest/workspaces/default/deployments/` .
Choose the `a9s-mongodb-service-...` deployment.
<pre class="terminal">

6. Run `bosh run errand deployment-updater` to force a service instances update for all existing a9s MongoDB for PCF instances.
<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh run errand deployment-updater
